Hashtable is a data structure just like lists and arrays. It is necessary because of it's speed of storage,search and retrieval of data.

Hashtable structure provides uniform access time for all data items unlike other data structures. Where speed is needed, hashtable is the best choice.

Hash table uses a hash function to determine an index for a given key-value pair. Value returned from a hash function can be used to access the data in 0(1) time.

In this project, we are tasked to implement our theoritecal understanding of hashtable with codes.
